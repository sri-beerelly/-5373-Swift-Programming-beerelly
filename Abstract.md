#**Comparison of mobile device growth in last 5-10 years**
##**Abstract**
Mobile devices have drastically changed the process we interact with each other. During the past 5-10 years, technological improvements have made exceptional modifications in the design of mobile devices and mobile device usage grew ever faster over this time period. The main intent of this paper is to provide details about the comparison of mobile device growth in last 5-10 years. This paper discusses advancements in memory, size, processor speed and number of cores of mobile devices. The goal of this paper to present an architectural overview describing the improvements and inclusions added to mobile devices.
